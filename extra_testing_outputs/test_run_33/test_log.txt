- **Feasibility Check**:
  - **E-commerce Functionality**: The initial conversation does not explicitly mention selling products online. If the intention is to include an online store with features like shopping cart, payment processing, and order tracking, this adds complexity. If not feasible within the current scope, consider providing detailed product information with contact options for purchases.
  - **Blog Integration**: While content-rich sections like blogs enhance SEO and customer engagement, integrating a full-fledged blog might exceed the three-page limit. Instead, incorporate a "Skincare Tips" section within the Home or About Us page to share valuable content without adding an extra page.
  - **Customer Reviews**: Implementing dynamic customer review functionality can be technically demanding. As an alternative, include curated testimonials on the Home and About Us pages to maintain credibility without complex systems.
  - **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is fully responsive across all devices. This is essential but requires careful design and testing to achieve a seamless user experience.
  - **High-Quality Imagery**: Sourcing or creating high-resolution images for products and ingredients is crucial for aesthetic appeal. Ensure availability of professional photography resources.
  - **SEO Optimization**: To enhance visibility, incorporate SEO best practices in content and structure. This includes keyword optimization, meta tags, and optimized images. Allocate resources for ongoing SEO efforts post-launch.
  - **Maintenance and Updates**: Regular updates to product information, testimonials, and content sections are necessary to keep the website current. Plan for ongoing maintenance to ensure functionality and relevance.

  **Suggestions**:
  - Prioritize essential features that align with the brand's goals and resource capabilities.
  - If e-commerce is a future goal, design the Products page with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of shopping features later.
  - Utilize content management systems like WordPress with appropriate plugins to balance functionality and ease of use.
  - Ensure all design elements reflect the brand's organic and cruelty-free ethos to maintain consistency and authenticity.
