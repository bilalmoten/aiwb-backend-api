The footer should be consistent across all pages as well.\n\nEnsure all pages have a consistent header with navigation and a consistent footer.\n\nhere are some component codes to help u out, please remember, the component codes are just to help u get started, and not to be used as is, if u do that, the website will look like a template and not a custom website. As an experienced website designer and developer, you are expected to use the base codes as a starting point and then build on them to create a custom website for the user. Colours, text, styling, additional effects, and everything is yours to customise, to make sure the user gets the best website possible.\n    \n    {\'Hero_1\': \'<div class="bg-white pb-6 sm:pb-8 lg:pb-12">\\n    <div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-2xl px-4 md:px-8">\\n        <header class="mb-8 flex items-center justify-between py-4 md:mb-12 md:py-8 xl:mb-16">\\n            <!-- logo - start -->\\n            <a href="/" class="inline-flex items-center gap-2.5 text-2xl font-bold text-black md:text-3xl"\\n                aria-label="logo">\\n                <svg width="95" height="94" viewBox="0 0 95 94" class="h-auto w-6 text-indigo-500" fill="currentColor"\\n                    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\\n                    <path d="M96 0V47L48 94H0V47L48 0H96Z" />\\n                </svg>\\n\\n                Flowrift\\n            </a>\\n            <!-- logo - end -->\\n\\n            <!-- nav - start -->\\n            <nav class="hidden gap-12 lg:flex">\\n                <a href="#" class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-500">Home</a>\\n                <a href="#"\\n                    class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 transition duration-100 hover:text-indigo-500 active:text-indigo-700">Features</a>\\n                <a href="#"\\n                    class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 transition duration-100 hover:text-indigo-500 active:text-indigo-700">Pricing</a>\\n                <a href="#"\\n                    class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 transition duration-100 hover:text-indigo-500 active:text-indigo-700">About</a>\\n            </nav>\\n            <!-- nav - end -->\\n\\n            <!-- buttons - start -->\\n            <a href="#"\\n                class="hidden rounded-lg bg-gray-200 px-8 py-3 text-center text-sm font-semibold text-gray-500 outline-none ring-indigo-300 transition duration-100 hover:bg-gray-300 focus-visible:ring active:text-gray-700 md:text-base lg:inline-block">Contact\\n                Sales</a>\\n\\n            <button type="button"\\n                class="inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-lg bg-gray-200 px-2.5 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-500 ring-indigo-300 hover:bg-gray-300 focus-visible:ring active:text-gray-700 md:text-base lg:hidden">\\n                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor">\\n                    <path fill-rule="evenodd"\\n                        d="M3 5a1 1 0 011-1h12a1 1 0 110 2H4a1 1 0 01-1-1zM3 10a1 1 0 011-1h6a1 1 0 110 2H4a1 1 0 01-1-1zM3 15a1 1 0 011-1h12a1 1 0 110 2H4a1 1 0 01-1-1z"\\n                        clip-rule="evenodd" />\\n                </svg>\\n\\n                Menu\\n            </button>\\n            <!-- buttons - end -->\\n        </header>\\n\\n        <section class="flex flex-col justify-between gap-6 sm:gap-10 md:gap-16 lg:flex-row">\\n            <!-- content - start -->\\n            <div class="flex flex-col justify-center sm:text-center lg:py-12 lg:text-left xl:w-5/12 xl:py-24">\\n                <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-indigo-500 md:mb-6 md:text-lg xl:text-xl">Very proud to introduce</p>\\n\\n                <h1 class="mb-8 text-4xl font-bold text-black sm:text-5xl md:mb-12 md:text-6xl">Revolutionary way to\\n                    build the web</h1>\\n\\n                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-gray-500 md:mb-12 lg:w-4/5 xl:text-lg">This is a section of some\\n                    simple filler text, also known as placeholder text.

The footer should be consistent across all pages as well.\n\nEnsure all pages have a consistent header with navigation and a consistent footer.\n\nhere are some component codes to help u out, please remember, the component codes are just to help u get started, and not to be used as is, if u do that, the website will look like a template and not a custom website. As an experienced website designer and developer, you are expected to use the base codes as a starting point and then build on them to create a custom website for the user. Colours, text, styling, additional effects, and everything is yours to customise, to make sure the user gets the best website possible.\n    \n    {\'Hero_1\': \'<div class="bg-white pb-6 sm:pb-8 lg:pb-12">\\n    <div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-2xl px-4 md:px-8">\\n        <header class="mb-8 flex items-center justify-between py-4 md:mb-12 md:py-8 xl:mb-16">\\n            <!-- logo - start -->\\n            <a href="/" class="inline-flex items-center gap-2.5 text-2xl font-bold text-black md:text-3xl"\\n                aria-label="logo">\\n                <svg width="95" height="94" viewBox="0 0 95 94" class="h-auto w-6 text-indigo-500" fill="currentColor"\\n                    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\\n                    <path d="M96 0V47L48 94H0V47L48 0H96Z" />\\n                </svg>\\n\\n                Flowrift\\n            </a>\\n            <!-- logo - end -->\\n\\n            <!-- nav - start -->\\n            <nav class="hidden gap-12 lg:flex">\\n                <a href="#" class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-500">Home</a>\\n                <a href="#"\\n                    class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 transition duration-100 hover:text-indigo-500 active:text-indigo-700">Features</a>\\n                <a href="#"\\n                    class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 transition duration-100 hover:text-indigo-500 active:text-indigo-700">Pricing</a>\\n                <a href="#"\\n                    class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 transition duration-100 hover:text-indigo-500 active:text-indigo-700">About</a>\\n            </nav>\\n            <!-- nav - end -->\\n\\n            <!-- buttons - start -->\\n            <a href="#"\\n                class="hidden rounded-lg bg-gray-200 px-8 py-3 text-center text-sm font-semibold text-gray-500 outline-none ring-indigo-300 transition duration-100 hover:bg-gray-300 focus-visible:ring active:text-gray-700 md:text-base lg:inline-block">Contact\\n                Sales</a>\\n\\n            <button type="button"\\n                class="inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-lg bg-gray-200 px-2.5 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-500 ring-indigo-300 hover:bg-gray-300 focus-visible:ring active:text-gray-700 md:text-base lg:hidden">\\n                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="currentColor">\\n                    <path fill-rule="evenodd"\\n                        d="M3 5a1 1 0 011-1h12a1 1 0 110 2H4a1 1 0 01-1-1zM3 10a1 1 0 011-1h6a1 1 0 110 2H4a1 1 0 01-1-1zM3 15a1 1 0 011-1h12a1 1 0 110 2H4a1 1 0 01-1-1z"\\n                        clip-rule="evenodd" />\\n                </svg>\\n\\n                Menu\\n            </button>\\n            <!-- buttons - end -->\\n        </header>\\n\\n        <section class="flex flex-col justify-between gap-6 sm:gap-10 md:gap-16 lg:flex-row">\\n            <!-- content - start -->\\n            <div class="flex flex-col justify-center sm:text-center lg:py-12 lg:text-left xl:w-5/12 xl:py-24">\\n                <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-indigo-500 md:mb-6 md:text-lg xl:text-xl">Very proud to introduce</p>\\n\\n                <h1 class="mb-8 text-4xl font-bold text-black sm:text-5xl md:mb-12 md:text-6xl">Revolutionary way to\\n                    build the web</h1>\\n\\n                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-gray-500 md:mb-12 lg:w-4/5 xl:text-lg">This is a section of some\\n                    simple filler text, also known as placeholder text.
